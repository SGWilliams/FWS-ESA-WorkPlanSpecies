# FWS ESA Work Plan Species Evaluation

This repository contains code for processing a list of 363 species that the USFWS has on their workplan as candidate species in the petition process through the Taxa Information Registry, a set of data processing algorithms we are developing under the Biogeographic Information System. This is all very experimental at this stage and should not be used beyond internal evaluation and discussions. The purpose of this exercise is to examine what all information we can bring together from across various available public data sources to aid in the work of evaluating the current state of scientific knowledge about these species.

This identifier is different from the SPCODE or ENTITY_ID that is available in other parts of ECOS, and there does not appear to be a public API available to key on that identifier. The web links lead to public landing pages for the species that have a collection of useful information that we may look to parse out for analysis later. For now, we use the species scientific name to find the species in ECOS TESS and bring back any of its information for later use."
